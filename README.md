Developed an interest in Data Science eventually while pursuing my Electronics Engineering and that’s when I decided to be a Data Scientist which led me to take a course in IBM Data Science Specialization (Coursera). And, after completing all 8 courses in the Specialization I discovered Python is the base of Data Science and being from an Electronics Engg background I have little knowledge in Python but all these 8 courses gave me a complete idea of how to use Python and its libraries which are the key for analysing data. So, coming to the point the biggest task for me was to clear Capstone Project but due to lack of time I had to refer some readily available Capstone Assignments in GitHub and then I encountered a Capstone Project of Shekhar Ramesh Sir in GitHub which gave me a deep understanding of how Data Science works in Real World. As said before I had to finish up the Course by 14th March 2020 and thus I had to fork Shekhar Ramesh project in order to complete the course. 

To be honest, our financial condition is very bad for last 5-6 years and my parents had already spent a lot in my Education and keeping that in mind I’ve decided not to burden them anymore by asking for money to complete courses or anything that can be troublesome to them. So, this is the main reason why I had to use someone else’s work (couldn’t seek the permission due to time constraints).

One thing is for sure that I can proudly refer his name in my future endeavours as his work helped me in completing IBM Data Science Capstone project.
I heartfully thank Shekar Ramesh Sir in helping me through his work.
